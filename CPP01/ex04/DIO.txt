Oh? You’re approaching me? Instead of running away, you’re coming right to me? Even though your grandfather, Joseph, told you the secret of The World, like an exam student scrambling to finish the problems on an exam until the last moments before the chime?

I can’t beat the shit out of you without getting closer.

Oh ho! Then come as close as you like.
